# Deliverance MCP Guide: Fiction Writing Through All MCPs

**Purpose:** Apply all MCPs to fiction writing using James Dickey's *Deliverance* (1970) as the teaching example.  
**Teaching Example:** *Deliverance* by James Dickey  
**Deliverance Context:** Ed (narrator, ad executive); Bobby (insurance salesman); Lewis (outdoorsman, survivalist); Drew (guitarist). Four men canoe the fictional Cahulawassee River in Georgia before it's dammed. Inbred mountain men attack; Drew killed; Bobby sexually assaulted; Lewis injured. Ed kills one attacker with bow and arrow; they cover up deaths and return. Themes: civilization vs. wilderness, masculinity, violence, survival. Climax: Ed's climb to kill the remaining attacker. Famous: "Squeal like a pig"; Ed's bow kill; cover-up; Ed's nightmares.

## Part II: Sequential Thinking Brothers → Unified Point of View

### Question 1: Should Ed kill the remaining attacker, or try to escape without killing?

| Brother | Analysis | Key Output |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Reference** | (1) Lewis is injured; Bobby is traumatized. (2) The attacker will kill them if Ed doesn't act. (3) No law, no rescue—wilderness logic. (4) Ed has the bow; he's the only one who can. (5) Dickey's survival-thriller logic favors action. | Kill is structurally necessary. |
| **Ultra** | Bias check: No confirmation bias (evidence supports kill). Branches: Kill (survival), Escape (risky), Wait (Lewis dies). Scores: Kill 94% thematic fit. | Kill scores highest. |
| **MAS** | Factual: Timeline supports Ed acting alone. Emotional: Ed must act or they all die. Critical: Theme of ordinary man pushed to extremity. Creative: Escape would require abandoning Lewis. Synthesis: Kill. | All agents converge on kill. |
| **Enhanced** | Creative mode: Kill, escape, wait. Evaluative mode: Kill scores 94% for survival-thriller conventions. | Kill validated. |
| **Rust** | Same logic; faster. Confirms: Kill is the structurally correct choice. | Kill. |

**Unified Point of View:** Ed should kill the remaining attacker. Lewis is incapacitated; Bobby is traumatized; Drew is dead. The attacker will hunt them down. There is no rescue, no law—only wilderness logic. Ed has the bow; he's the only one who can act. Dickey's survival-thriller logic requires the kill. The five brothers agree.

---

### Question 2: Why doesn't Ed tell the sheriff the truth when they return?

| Brother | Analysis | Key Output |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Reference** | (1) Drew is dead; attackers are dead. (2) Telling truth = arrest, trial, media. (3) Bobby would have to testify about the assault. (4) Lewis shot one; Ed killed one—both face charges. (5) Cover-up protects them; Dickey's theme (civilization vs. wilderness) requires the lie. | Cover-up is structurally necessary. |
| **Ultra** | Bias check: No availability heuristic. Branches: Tell truth (legal justice, 45%), Cover-up (survival, 92%). | Cover-up scores higher thematically. |
| **MAS** | Factual: They would all be implicated. Emotional: Bobby cannot face testimony. Critical: Theme of civilization's hypocrisy—they return to "civilization" by lying. Synthesis: Cover-up. | Cover-up. |
| **Enhanced** | Evaluative: Dickey's oeuvre supports moral ambiguity. Creative: Truth would destroy the novel's structure. | Cover-up validated. |
| **Rust** | Verification: Cover-up is the correct structural choice. | Cover-up. |

**Unified Point of View:** Ed doesn't tell the sheriff because the cover-up protects them all. Drew is dead; the attackers are dead. Telling the truth means arrest, trial, Bobby testifying about the assault, Lewis and Ed facing charges. Dickey's theme—civilization vs. wilderness, the lie that lets them return—requires the cover-up. The brothers agree.

---

### Question 3: Should Ed climb the cliff to kill the attacker, or wait for Lewis to recover?

| Brother | Analysis | Key Output |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Reference** | (1) Lewis cannot move; recovery would take days. (2) The attacker is above them; he has the advantage. (3) Ed must climb or they die. (4) Dickey's survival logic: act or be hunted. (5) The climb is the novel's physical and moral climax. | Climb. |
| **Ultra** | Branches: Climb (92%), Wait (35%). Bias: "Wait" risks convenience—how would Lewis recover in time? | Climb scores higher. |
| **MAS** | Emotional: Ed must overcome his own fear. Critical: The climb is Ed's transformation. Factual: No other option. | Climb. |
| **Enhanced** | Creative: Waiting creates anticlimax. Evaluative: Climb fits survival-thriller structure. | Climb. |
| **Rust** | Verification: Climb is the correct structural choice. | Climb. |

**Unified Point of View:** Ed should climb the cliff. Lewis cannot move; the attacker is above them. Waiting means being hunted. The climb is Ed's physical and moral climax—ordinary man pushed to extremity. Dickey's survival logic requires action. All brothers agree.

---

### Question 4: Is Ed's kill justified?

| Brother | Analysis | Key Output |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Reference** | (1) The attacker murdered Drew. (2) The attacker assaulted Bobby. (3) The attacker will kill them if Ed doesn't act. (4) No legal authority; wilderness logic. (5) Ed acts from necessity, not malice. | Yes—narratively and thematically justified. |
| **Ultra** | Paths: Legal (arrest—impossible) 20%; Moral (kill—88%); Thematic (kill—95%). | Kill is justified. |
| **MAS** | Emotional: Catharsis is earned; survival is paramount. Critical: Theme supports "ordinary man pushed to extremity." Factual: Attacker's crimes warrant lethal response. | Justified. |
| **Enhanced** | Evaluative: Dickey's survival-thriller logic supports it. Creative: Alternatives weaken thematic coherence. | Justified. |
| **Rust** | Verification: All evidence supports justification. | Justified. |

**Unified Point of View:** Yes. Ed's kill is justified. The attacker murdered Drew, assaulted Bobby, and will kill them. There is no law, no rescue. Ed acts from necessity—ordinary man pushed to extremity. The brothers agree.

---

### Question 5: How do we ensure the assault scene maintains logical consistency and appropriate treatment?

| Brother | Analysis | Key Output |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Reference** | (1) Bobby's knowledge: he knows who attacked him. (2) Ed's knowledge: he hears, doesn't see. (3) Timeline: assault occurs after Drew's death. (4) Treatment: avoid gratuitous detail; focus on aftermath, trauma. (5) Dickey's approach: implication, not exploitation. | Logic holds; treat with restraint. |
| **Ultra** | Quality: Consistency 92%. Flag: Ensure Bobby's trauma is respected; no sensationalism. | Restraint and consistency. |
| **MAS** | Factual: Verify timeline (Drew dead → assault). Emotional: Bobby's trauma must read as authentic. Critical: No moment that exploits. Creative: Restraint strengthens impact. | Audit for logic and restraint. |
| **Enhanced** | Evaluative: Dickey's prose style—spare, visceral, not graphic. | Restraint validated. |
| **Rust** | Full-scene scan: Consistency and restraint. | Audit every line. |

**Unified Point of View:** Ensure timeline is correct (Drew dead → assault) and Bobby's knowledge state is consistent. Treat the assault with restraint—implication over exploitation. Dickey's approach: spare, visceral, focused on aftermath and trauma. Audit every line for logic and appropriate treatment. The brothers agree.

## Part III: Expanded Deliverance Examples (10 Sentences Each) – All MCPs

### Knowledge Graph Memory MCP

**Fiction Use (10 sentences):** Knowledge Graph Memory MCP stores your characters, relationships, plot threads, and world-building in a structured graph so you can query them like a database. For *Deliverance*, you would store Ed as an entity with attributes: ad executive, narrator, bow skills (learned from Lewis), and relationships to Lewis (respect), Bobby (pity/concern), Drew (friend). You would store Lewis with attributes: survivalist, outdoorsman, injured in attack, shot one attacker. You would store Bobby with attributes: insurance salesman, assaulted, traumatized. You would store Drew with attributes: guitarist, killed by mountain men. You would store the Cahulawassee, the mountain men, and the cover-up as plot nodes. When you ask "Who knows about the cover-up?" the graph returns: Ed, Lewis, Bobby—and no one else. When you ask "When did Drew die relative to Bobby's assault?" you get a clear timeline. This keeps your story's truth consistent across chapters and revisions.

**Deliverance Example (10 sentences):** *"What are Ed's unresolved conflicts at the end?"* The Knowledge Graph returns: (1) Drew's death—Ed blames himself for not acting sooner. (2) The kill—Ed crossed a line; he is changed. (3) The cover-up—lying to the sheriff, burying the truth. (4) Return to civilization—Ed cannot unsee what he did. The graph tracks Ed's arc: ordinary man → survivor → killer → haunted. It maintains the timeline: canoe in → attack → Drew dead → Bobby assaulted → Lewis injured → Ed climbs → Ed kills → cover-up → return. By querying the graph before writing each scene, you ensure Ed's motivation, Bobby's trauma, and the cover-up logic stay aligned. The graph becomes your single source of truth for the novel.

### Sequential Thinking MCP (Reference)

**Fiction Use (10 sentences):** Sequential Thinking MCP forces the model to reason step by step, making plot logic and character decisions explicit. For *Deliverance*, when you ask "Why doesn't Ed tell the sheriff?" the MCP breaks it down: (1) Drew is dead; attackers are dead. (2) Telling truth means arrest, trial. (3) Bobby would have to testify about the assault. (4) Lewis and Ed would face charges. (5) The cover-up lets them return to "civilization" by lying. Each step can be verified against the manuscript. When you ask "Should Ed kill the attacker?" the MCP lays out: Lewis injured, Bobby traumatized, no rescue, Ed has the bow, Dickey's survival logic. It reduces plot holes by making cause-and-effect chains visible. The chain of reasoning becomes part of your editorial record.

**Deliverance Example (10 sentences):** *"Should Ed climb the cliff to kill the attacker or wait for Lewis?"* Sequential Thinking produces: (1) Lewis cannot move; recovery would take days. (2) The attacker is above them; he has the advantage. (3) Ed must act or they will be hunted. (4) Dickey's survival-thriller logic favors action over waiting. (5) The climb is the novel's physical and moral climax. (6) Ed has the bow; he's the only one who can. (7) Waiting means death—the attacker will find them. (8) The thematic arc (ordinary man → survivor → killer) requires Ed to choose action. (9) Conclusion: Climb. (10) The chain supports the final choice and can be cited if you later question the scene.

### Sequential Thinking Ultra

**Fiction Use (10 sentences):** Sequential Thinking Ultra adds bias checks, quality metrics, and branching. For *Deliverance*, when you ask "Is Ed's kill justified?" Ultra explores multiple paths: legal (impossible—no authority), moral (kill for survival), thematic (what does the novel require?). It scores each path for consistency with Ed's character and Dickey's survival-thriller conventions. It flags cognitive biases: e.g., are you assuming Ed must kill because that's the "obvious" ending? Or because the evidence supports it? Ultra distinguishes. It also flags when plot choices are driven by convenience. The quality metrics give you confidence scores. Branching lets you explore alternatives without losing the main argument.

**Deliverance Example (10 sentences):** *"Is Ed's kill justified?"* Ultra explores three paths: (1) Ed kills the attacker—scores 94% for thematic fit, 90% for moral logic; bias check: no confirmation bias, evidence supports kill. (2) Ed tries to escape without killing—scores 35%; would require contrived rescue. (3) Ed waits for Lewis—scores 40%; Lewis cannot recover in time. Ultra's quality metrics: Path 1 has highest consistency with Ed's arc and Dickey's survival logic. The bias detector notes: we are not overemphasizing "violence" for its own sake; the novel has established the attacker's crimes and the survival stakes. The recommendation: Kill is justified. Ultra also warns: ensure Ed's act reads as necessity, not heroism—the thematic score depends on moral complexity.

### Sequential Thinking MAS (Multi-Agent System)

**Fiction Use (10 sentences):** Sequential Thinking MAS uses five agents—Factual, Emotional, Critical, Creative, Synthesis—for multi-angle analysis. For *Deliverance*, when you ask "Should Ed kill the attacker?" the Factual agent checks: timeline (Drew dead, Bobby assaulted, Lewis injured), evidence chain (attacker's crimes), structural requirements (climax must pay off). The Emotional agent evaluates: Does Ed need to act? Would kill provide closure or emptiness? The Critical agent checks: plot holes, thematic consistency. The Creative agent suggests alternatives: escape, wait, negotiate. The Synthesis agent combines all views. Each agent surfaces issues the others miss.

**Deliverance Example (10 sentences):** *"Should Ed kill the remaining attacker?"* MAS produces: Factual agent: Timeline supports Ed acting alone; attacker's crimes (Drew's murder, Bobby's assault) warrant lethal response; no legal authority present. Emotional agent: Ed's trauma (Drew's death, Bobby's assault, Lewis's injury) creates need for agency; killing provides survival; inaction means death. Critical agent: Dickey's survival-thriller structure requires confrontation; theme of "civilization vs. wilderness" supports kill; no plot hole if Ed acts alone. Creative agent: Alternatives (escape, wait) are implausible; Ed's kill is the structurally correct choice. Synthesis agent: All agents converge—Ed should kill the attacker. The MAS output gives you confidence that the decision is sound across logic, emotion, theme, and structure.

---

### Sequential Thinking Enhanced

**Fiction Use (10 sentences):** Enhanced Sequential Thinking adds 19 thinking modes. For *Deliverance*, when brainstorming alternate outcomes for the climax, you switch to creative mode: the system generates paths (Ed kills, Ed escapes, Ed waits, attacker dies accidentally). When checking consistency (Drew's death vs. assault timeline), you use evaluative mode. When verifying timeline (Ed's climb, Lewis's injury), you use linear mode. The system matches reasoning style to the task. For plot brainstorming, creative mode; for continuity checks, evaluative mode; for timeline verification, linear mode.

**Deliverance Example (10 sentences):** *"Explore alternative outcomes for the cliff climax"* Enhanced Sequential Thinking in creative mode generates: (1) Ed kills the attacker—direct payoff, survival, thematic closure. (2) Ed escapes without killing—would require deus ex machina. (3) Ed waits for Lewis—Lewis cannot recover; implausible. (4) Attacker dies accidentally—removes Ed's agency, weakens theme. (5) Ed wounds attacker, who flees—enables sequel, but undercuts this novel's arc. Switching to evaluative mode, the system scores each: (1) 95%, (2) 25%, (3) 30%, (4) 35%, (5) 55%. The recommendation: Path 1 (Ed kills) scores highest. You have both a range of alternatives and a scored ranking.

---

### Sequential Thinking (Rust Version)

**Fiction Use (10 sentences):** Sequential Thinking Rust is the same reasoning engine, implemented in Rust for speed. For *Deliverance*, when you run Sequential Thinking across all chapters—checking timeline consistency, character knowledge states, plot logic—the Rust version processes the full manuscript in seconds. It returns: timeline checks (attack, Drew's death, assault, Ed's climb, cover-up), character consistency (Ed's transformation, Bobby's trauma, Lewis's injury), plot-hole flags. The output is identical in quality; the difference is performance. For full-manuscript analysis, the Rust version reduces latency.

**Deliverance Example (10 sentences):** *"Analyze plot logic across all chapters"* The Rust version processes the full manuscript and returns: Timeline check: Attack precedes Drew's death; assault follows; Lewis injured; Ed climbs; Ed kills; cover-up; return—no temporal inversions. Character consistency: Ed's knowledge state—verified at each beat; Bobby's trauma—consistent; Lewis's injury—consistent. Plot-hole flags: (1) Ensure Ed never sees the assault—he hears it. (2) Ensure cover-up logic is clear—why they lie. (3) Verify Ed's bow skills are established before the climax. The Rust version completes this in under 30 seconds. You get the same rigor with faster turnaround.

## Part IV: All MCPs with Deliverance Examples

### Cognee MCP

**Fiction Use:** Graph-RAG that finds links between concepts you didn't explicitly create. For *Deliverance*, it can surface that the Cahulawassee (soon to be dammed) connects to civilization vs. wilderness, that Ed's bow (Lewis's skill) connects to Ed's transformation, that the cover-up connects to the novel's moral ambiguity.

**Deliverance Example:** *"How does the river connect to the novel's themes?"* → Cognee traces: Cahulawassee (wilderness, soon destroyed) → civilization's encroachment → the trip (last chance) → attack (wilderness strikes back) → cover-up (civilization's lie). It makes the symbol's meaning explicit.

---

### Fireproof MCP

**Fiction Use:** Stores JSON documents with sync and versioning. Use for character sheets, scene summaries, timeline notes.

**Deliverance Example:** Store: `{ "character": "Ed", "key_detail": "Ad executive, narrator; learns bow from Lewis; kills attacker; covers up; haunted" }`. Later: "Show me all Ed POV scenes" for consistency and pacing.

---

### Mem0 / OpenMemory MCP

**Fiction Use:** Persistent memory across sessions. Stores facts, preferences, decisions.

**Deliverance Example:** After you say "The cover-up should mirror the river's fate—both are civilization's lie," Mem0 stores it. Later, when editing, the assistant reminds you of that choice.

---

### mcp-mermaid MCP

**Fiction Use:** Generate diagrams for plot structure, character relationships, timelines.

**Deliverance Example:** *"Create a character relationship diagram for Ed, Lewis, Bobby, Drew"* → Mermaid produces: Ed (narrator) → Lewis (mentor), Bobby (pity), Drew (friend); Lewis → Ed (teaches bow); attack → Drew (killed), Bobby (assaulted), Lewis (injured), Ed (kills). Visual map of the novel's structure.

---

### walk-this-way (Filesystem) MCP

**Fiction Use:** Direct file access for drafts, outlines, character sheets.

**Deliverance Example:** "Read chapter 8 (the assault) and my character sheet for Bobby" → Filesystem MCP returns the files; Claude uses them for consistency and appropriate treatment.

---

### duckduckgo-search MCP

**Fiction Use:** Fast fact-checking and research.

**Deliverance Example:** *"What was whitewater canoeing like in Georgia in 1970?"* → Search MCP returns facts to keep the Cahulawassee scenes grounded.

---

### GitKraken / GitHub MCP

**Fiction Use:** Version control for drafts. Branches for alternate plotlines.

**Deliverance Example:** "Create a branch for the alternate ending where Ed tells the sheriff" → Git creates the branch; you compare endings without losing the main draft.

---

### Linear MCP

**Fiction Use:** Project management for novel tasks.

**Deliverance Example:** "Create an issue: Revise the cliff climb scene for thematic clarity" → Linear MCP creates the issue; you track it in your novel project.

---

### Style Emulation MCP

**Fiction Use:** Matches prose to a target style (e.g., Dickey).

**Deliverance Example:** Feed Dickey's prose, create a profile, then compare your draft. Get: "Shorten sentences; increase sensory detail; match Dickey's spare, muscular rhythm."

---

### Firecrawl MCP

**Fiction Use:** Deep web scraping for research.

**Deliverance Example:** "Research Georgia whitewater, Cahulawassee River, 1970s dam projects" → Firecrawl pulls articles; you use them for the novel's setting.

---

### Vectara MCP

**Fiction Use:** Semantic search across the manuscript.

**Deliverance Example:** "Find all scenes where Ed feels guilt" → Vectara returns thematic matches for revision and emotional consistency.

---

### Pattern Finder MCP

**Fiction Use:** Detects repetition, overused words.

**Deliverance Example:** "Find all instances of 'river' and 'water'" → Pattern Finder returns locations; you decide where to trim or amplify.

---

### Text-to-Speech MCP

**Fiction Use:** Read drafts aloud for rhythm and flow.

**Deliverance Example:** Send the cliff climb scene to TTS; listen; notice if the prose lands with the right tension and rhythm.

---

### Anki MCP

**Fiction Use:** Flashcards for continuity.

**Deliverance Example:** Create cards: "When did Drew die?" → "During the attack, before Bobby's assault." "Ed's bow skills?" → "Learned from Lewis before the trip." Review before writing.

---

### Pandoc MCP

**Fiction Use:** Convert Markdown to DOCX, PDF, EPUB.

**Deliverance Example:** "Convert my manuscript to DOCX for my editor" → Pandoc MCP produces a formatted document.

## Part V: Unified Recommendations Summary (Deliverance)

| Question | Unified Answer |
|----------|----------------|
| Should Ed kill the attacker? | Yes. All brothers agree: kill is structurally necessary. |
| Why doesn't Ed tell the sheriff? | Cover-up protects them; Dickey's theme requires the lie. |
| Climb or wait for Lewis? | Climb. Lewis cannot recover; waiting means death. |
| Is Ed's kill justified? | Yes. Attacker's crimes, survival stakes, Dickey's logic support it. |
| How to ensure assault-scene consistency? | Verify timeline; treat with restraint; audit every line. |
